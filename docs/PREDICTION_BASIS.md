# Theoretical Background: The 120-Cell Interpretation

## Overview

The observed value γ ≈ 1.878 may arise from geometric constraints in phase space related to the 120-cell polytope, a regular 4-dimensional structure.

## The 120-Cell Polytope

The 120-cell is one of six regular convex 4-polytopes. Key properties:

- **Vertices:** 600
- **Edges:** 1200  
- **Faces:** 720 (pentagonal)
- **Cells:** 120 (dodecahedral)

It represents optimal packing in 4D space and has deep connections to icosahedral symmetry and the golden ratio.

## Why Non-Thermal?

Self-gravitating systems violate classical statistical mechanics assumptions:

1. **Long-range forces:** Gravity doesn't satisfy short-range interaction assumptions
2. **Non-additivity:** Energy is not simply the sum of subsystem energies
3. **Incomplete relaxation:** Violent relaxation (Lynden-Bell 1967) doesn't achieve true thermal equilibrium

### Tsallis Statistics

Power-law velocity distributions arise naturally in the Tsallis non-extensive framework:

```
S_q = k_B × (1 - Σp_i^q) / (q - 1)
```

The observed γ ≈ 1.878 corresponds to q ≈ 3.3, indicating significant departure from extensive (q = 1) Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics.

## Geometric Interpretation

The 120-cell hypothesis proposes that accessible phase space is geometrically constrained, leading to:

- Specific power-law exponents in velocity distributions
- Oscillatory radial profiles
- Universal structure across self-gravitating systems

A complete derivation connecting 120-cell geometry to γ = 1.878 remains an open problem.
