# QUICK START GUIDE
## For Resuming Gamma-1.878 Project in New Claude Session

---

## STEP 1: Upload This Folder

Upload the entire `gamma1878_repo` folder to Claude.

---

## STEP 2: Initial Prompt

Copy and paste this to Claude:

```
I'm Vincent Tyson, continuing work on my gamma-1.878 cosmology project. I've uploaded my project repository. Please read the MASTER_BRIEFING.md file first to understand the full context, then let me know you're ready to continue.

Key context:
- Paper #1 submitted to MNRAS (detection of γ = 1.878)
- Paper #2 in preparation (Peebles connection)
- Critical: Taylor-Navarro (2001) prior art discovered
- The synthesis (connecting velocity/spatial/phase-space exponents) appears novel
```

---

## STEP 3: Verify Understanding

Claude should be able to answer:

1. What is γ = 1.878?
2. What did Taylor & Navarro find in 2001?
3. How does my work differ from theirs?
4. What is the QROCODILE prediction?
5. What citations are required for Paper #2?

## KEY FILES TO REFERENCE

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `MASTER_BRIEFING.md` | Complete project context |
| `literature/TAYLOR_NAVARRO_2001.md` | Critical prior art analysis |
| `literature/CITATIONS_REQUIRED.md` | BibTeX citations for Paper #2 |
| `docs/Paper2_Draft_29122025.md` | Current Paper #2 draft |
| `docs/QROCODILE_Prediction_Tyson_2025.md` | Falsifiable prediction |

## THE CORE CLAIM

> "Galactic halos preserve the fractal dimension of the cosmic web filaments from which they accreted. The velocity distribution exponent γ ≈ 1.878 equals the Peebles spatial correlation exponent because they are manifestations of the same underlying geometry."

---

## CURRENT STATUS

- [x] Paper #1: Submitted to MNRAS
- [x] Literature search: Complete (Taylor-Navarro found)
- [ ] Paper #2: Needs Taylor-Navarro integration
- [ ] Paper #2: Draft abstract needs revision
- [ ] QROCODILE: Awaiting observational test

---

## THE TRIPLE COINCIDENCE

| Domain | Exponent | Source |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Spatial (Peebles) | γ ≈ 1.77 | Galaxy surveys |
| Phase-space (T&N) | α ≈ 1.875 | CDM simulations |
| Velocity (Tyson) | γ ≈ 1.878 | FIRE-2, Gaia |

Standard physics: Three numbers.
Tyson's claim: One number, three manifestations.

## WHAT NOT TO DO

1. ❌ Don't claim to have discovered α = 1.875 (Taylor-Navarro did)
2. ❌ Don't ignore prior art (cite Taylor-Navarro prominently)
3. ❌ Don't overstate "replaces dark matter" in MNRAS submission
4. ❌ Don't conflate Q(r) with P(v) (they're related but different)

---

## WHAT TO DO

1. ✅ Frame work as explaining the ORIGIN of the known exponent
2. ✅ Emphasize Peebles connection as novel contribution
3. ✅ Present mechanism (fractal accretion memory)
4. ✅ Make falsifiable predictions (QROCODILE)
5. ✅ Be conservative in empirical paper, bold in theory paper
