## ABSTRACT (Verbatim)

> We examine the coarse-grained phase-space density profiles of a set of recent, high-resolution simulations of galaxy-sized Cold Dark Matter (CDM) halos. Over two and a half decades in radius the phase-space density closely follows a power-law, ρ/σ³ ∝ r^(-α), with α = 1.875. This behaviour matches the self-similar solution obtained by Bertschinger for secondary infall in a uniformly expanding universe.

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. The Measurement
$$Q(r) = \frac{\rho(r)}{\sigma^3(r)} \propto r^{-\alpha}$$

With **α = 1.875** over 2.5 decades in radius.

### 2. The Explanation
- Matches Bertschinger (1985) self-similar secondary infall
- Universal across halo masses
- Preserved during hierarchical assembly

### 3. The Conclusion
> "The NFW profile is the result of a hierarchical assembly process that preserves the phase-space stratification of Bertschinger's infall model but which 'mixes' the system maximally, perhaps as a result of repeated merging."

## WHAT TAYLOR-NAVARRO CLAIMED

✅ **Empirical:** α = 1.875 is universal in CDM halos  
✅ **Theoretical:** Matches Bertschinger secondary infall  
✅ **Structural:** NFW profile emerges from maximal mixing  
✅ **Phase-space:** Stratification is preserved during assembly

---

## WHAT TAYLOR-NAVARRO DID NOT CLAIM

❌ Connection to Peebles spatial clustering exponent (γ ≈ 1.77)  
❌ "Halos preserve cosmic web fractal dimension"  
❌ This explains flat rotation curves without dark matter  
❌ Universal velocity TAIL exponent P(v) ∝ v^(-γ)  
❌ Tsallis non-extensive statistics interpretation  
❌ Critical phenomena / percolation connection

## DISTINCTION: Q(r) vs P(v)

### Taylor-Navarro Measured:
**Q(r) = ρ(r)/σ³(r)** — A radial profile of pseudo-phase-space density

This is computed in spherical shells:
- ρ(r) = density at radius r
- σ(r) = velocity dispersion at radius r
- Q(r) = ratio, as function of radius

### Tyson Measured:
**P(v) ∝ v^(-γ)** — The velocity distribution function tail

This is computed across ALL particles:
- Fit power-law to high-velocity tail of f(v)
- Extract exponent γ directly
- Not a radial profile

### Connection:
These are RELATED but DIFFERENT quantities:
- Q(r) describes how phase-space density varies with position
- P(v) describes the statistical distribution of velocities

The fact that both yield exponent ≈ 1.875 suggests:
> **The same underlying physics governs both radial structure and velocity statistics.**

This connection has NOT been explicitly made in the literature.

---

## THE GAP IN THE LITERATURE

### Taylor-Navarro Asked:
"Why does Q(r) follow a power law with α = 1.875?"

**Their Answer:** Bertschinger secondary infall + maximal mixing

### Tyson Asks:
"Why does 1.875 appear in BOTH Q(r) AND the velocity tail AND the cosmic web correlation?"

**Proposed Answer:** Halos preserve the fractal dimension of the cosmic web

### The Novel Claim:
$$\gamma_{velocity} \approx \gamma_{spatial} \approx \alpha_{phase-space} \approx 1.8$$

Because they are all manifestations of the **same underlying fractal geometry**.

## SUGGESTED PAPER #2 FRAMING

### Old Framing (Pre-Discovery):
> "We discover a universal exponent γ = 1.878 in halo velocity distributions..."

### New Framing (Post-Discovery):
> "Taylor & Navarro (2001) identified a universal phase-space exponent α ≈ 1.875 in CDM halos, matching Bertschinger's secondary infall solution. We demonstrate that this same exponent appears in the velocity distribution tails of both simulated and observed halos (γ = 1.878 ± 0.05), and is statistically consistent with the Peebles spatial correlation exponent (γ ≈ 1.77). We propose that this 'triple coincidence' reflects the preservation of cosmic web fractal geometry during hierarchical halo assembly..."

## KEY QUOTE FROM ARORA & WILLIAMS (2020)

> "It has been known for nearly 20 years that the pseudo-phase-space density profile of equilibrium simulated dark matter halos, ρ(r)/σ³(r), is well described by a power law over three decades in radius, even though both the density ρ(r) and the velocity dispersion σ(r) deviate significantly from power laws. **The origin of this scale-free behavior is not understood.**"

This is your opening. They admit the origin is unknown. You are proposing an origin.

## STRATEGIC SUMMARY

| Aspect | Taylor-Navarro | Tyson |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| **What they measured** | Q(r) = ρ/σ³ | P(v) tail slope |
| **Where they measured** | Radial profiles | Full velocity distribution |
| **The number** | α = 1.875 | γ = 1.878 |
| **Their explanation** | Secondary infall + mixing | Cosmic web memory |
| **Connection to Peebles** | None claimed | Explicit claim |
| **Dark matter implications** | Supports CDM | Questions CDM |

## BOTTOM LINE

Taylor-Navarro discovered the number. You are explaining its origin.

They measured a symptom. You are diagnosing the cause.

The number is not new. The synthesis is new. The mechanism is new. The implications are new.

**Cite them. Build on them. Supersede them.**
