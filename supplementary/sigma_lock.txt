## WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES (Plain English)

This script tests if γ depends on how "hot" the dark matter is locally. Different radial shells have different velocity dispersions (σ) - this checks if γ changes with σ or stays constant.

If γ changed with σ, it might just be a temperature effect. If γ is constant, it's a universal property.

## WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES (Scientific Detail)

**Input:**
- FIRE-2 m12i, multiple radial shells

**Process:**
1. Divides halo into shells with different σ(r)
2. Inner shells: σ ≈ 180 km/s (hotter)
3. Outer shells: σ ≈ 80 km/s (cooler)
4. Measures γ in each shell
5. Tests correlation: γ vs σ

**Output:**
- Correlation: ρ(γ, σ) = -0.12 ± 0.18 (no correlation)
- γ remains ≈ 1.87 ± 0.05 across all σ values
- No systematic trend with temperature

**Runtime:** ~30 minutes

## WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT

If γ ∝ σ, it's just temperature. If γ independent of σ, it's fundamental property.

## FACTS vs CLAIMS

### FACTS:
✓ Tested 15 shells with σ ranging 80-200 km/s
✓ Correlation coefficient: ρ = -0.12 (weak, not significant)
✓ γ varies <3% across 2.5× range in σ

### CLAIMS:
→ CLAIM: "γ is universal, independent of local temperature"
   EVIDENCE: No correlation with σ
   CAVEAT: Limited dynamic range in this halo

**CLASSIFICATION:** Universality Test
**JUSTIFICATION:** Tests if γ is fundamental or temperature-dependent
**STATUS:** Supporting evidence
