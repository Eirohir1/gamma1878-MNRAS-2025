## WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES (Plain English)

This measures γ using THREE completely different statistical methods to see if they all agree. It's like measuring distance with ruler, laser, and GPS - if all agree, measurement is robust.

Methods: (1) Log-log regression (primary), (2) Maximum likelihood, (3) Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

## WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES (Scientific Detail)

**Process:**
1. **Method 1 - Log-log regression:**
   - Bins velocity histogram
   - Fits line to log(P) vs log(v)
   - Extracts γ from slope

2. **Method 2 - Maximum Likelihood:**
   - Unbinned analysis (uses raw velocities)
   - Maximizes L = Π P(vᵢ|γ)
   - Finds γ that maximizes likelihood

3. **Method 3 - Kolmogorov-Smirnov:**
   - Compares cumulative distributions
   - Tests P(v) = ∫ v^(-γ) dv against data
   - Finds γ minimizing K-S statistic

**Output:**
- Method 1: γ = 1.866 ± 0.012
- Method 2: γ = 1.871 ± 0.015
- Method 3: γ = 1.863 ± 0.018
- Mean: γ = 1.867
- Spread: 0.4% (excellent agreement)

**Runtime:** ~1 hour (ML is slow)

## WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT

Different methods have different systematic errors. Agreement proves result isn't method-dependent.

## FACTS vs CLAIMS

### FACTS:
✓ Three independent methods
✓ All give 1.86 < γ < 1.88
✓ Maximum spread: 0.008 (0.4%)
✓ All within 0.5σ of each other

### CLAIMS:
→ CLAIM: "γ = 1.866 is method-independent"
   EVIDENCE: Three methods converge
   CAVEAT: All methods assume power-law form
