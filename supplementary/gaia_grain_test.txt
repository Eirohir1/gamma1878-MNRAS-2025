# gaia_grain_test.py

## WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES (Plain English)

This is the ORIGINAL Gaia validation script (before Gaia_Grain_Scanner). It measures γ in Gaia DR3 stellar halo for the first time.

This was the "proof of concept" that led to the full parameter sweep (Gaia_Grain_Scanner).

## WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES (Scientific Detail)

**Process:**
1. Queries Gaia DR3 (single parameter set)
2. |v_r| > 250 km/s, error < 10 km/s
3. Measures γ_Gaia
4. Compares to NFW prediction

**Output:**
- γ_Gaia = 6.65 ± 0.54
- γ_NFW = 5.33
- First real-data validation

**Runtime:** ~5 minutes

## FACTS vs CLAIMS

### FACTS:
✓ First measurement of γ in real Milky Way
✓ γ_Gaia = 6.65 ± 0.54
✓ 2.44σ excess over NFW

### CLAIMS:
→ CLAIM: "Validates FIRE-2 result"
   EVIDENCE: Both show excess
   CAVEAT: Different systems, different γ values

**CLASSIFICATION:** Initial Validation (Historical)
**JUSTIFICATION:** First real-data check
**STATUS:** Superseded by Gaia_Grain_Scanner (more thorough)
**NOTE:** Keep for documentation, use Gaia_Validation_CORRECTED for publication
