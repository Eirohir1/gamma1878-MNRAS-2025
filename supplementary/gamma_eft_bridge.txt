## WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES (Plain English)

This derives the connection between γ = 1.878 and Tsallis non-extensive statistics using effective field theory formalism. It's building theoretical bridge between observed power-law and statistical mechanics.

**WARNING:** Mathematical framework only, physical justification lacking.

## WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES (Scientific Detail)

**Process:**
1. Starts with Tsallis q-Gaussian distribution
2. Power-law tail: P(v) ∝ v^(-(1+q)) for large v
3. Identifies: γ = 1 + q
4. For γ = 1.878: q = 0.878
5. Connects to escort probabilities and generalized entropy

**Output:**
- Formal derivation: γ = 1 + q
- Tsallis parameter: q = 0.878
- Escort distribution framework

**Runtime:** <1 minute (analytical)

## FACTS vs CLAIMS

### FACTS:
✓ Tsallis q-Gaussian has power-law tail with exponent -(1+q)
✓ If γ = 1 + q, then q = 0.878 for γ = 1.878
✓ Mathematics is correct

### CLAIMS (SPECULATIVE):
→ CLAIM: "Tsallis statistics apply to dark matter"
   EVIDENCE: Power-law observed (but many causes possible)

→ CLAIM: "q = 0.878 is fundamental parameter"
   EVIDENCE: Fits observed γ (but no physical derivation)

**CLASSIFICATION:** Theoretical Framework (Option B)
**JUSTIFICATION:** Mathematical connection established, physical meaning unclear
**STATUS:** Framework only, needs physical justification
**PUBLICATION:** ✗ NOT for Option A (too speculative)
