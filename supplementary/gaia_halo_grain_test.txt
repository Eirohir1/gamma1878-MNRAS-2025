# gaia_halo_grain_test.py

## WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES (Plain English)

Extended version of gaia_grain_test.py that tests multiple distance shells around the Sun. Checks if Gaia result depends on which stars you include (nearby vs distant).

## WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES (Scientific Detail)

**Process:**
1. Divides Gaia sample into distance shells
2. d < 1 kpc, 1-2 kpc, 2-5 kpc, 5-10 kpc
3. Measures γ in each shell
4. Tests distance dependence

**Output:**
- All shells show γ > 6.0
- No strong distance dependence
- Validates robustness across distances

**Runtime:** ~15 minutes

## FACTS vs CLAIMS

### FACTS:
✓ Tested 4 distance shells
✓ All show excess over NFW
✓ γ varies 6.2 to 7.0 (12% range)

### CLAIMS:
→ CLAIM: "Result distance-independent"
   EVIDENCE: All shells show excess
   CAVEAT: Limited statistics in inner shells

**CLASSIFICATION:** Extended Validation
**JUSTIFICATION:** Tests spatial dependence
**STATUS:** Preliminary (superseded by Gaia_Grain_Scanner)
