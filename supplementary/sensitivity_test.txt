## WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES (Plain English)

This tests robustness by adding random noise to the data and checking if γ stays stable. It's like testing if your speedometer still works when the road is bumpy.

Adds ±5% random velocity perturbations 1000 times and measures γ each time.

## WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES (Scientific Detail)

**Process:**
1. Takes FIRE-2 velocity distribution
2. For 1000 iterations:
   - Adds Gaussian noise: δv ~ N(0, 0.05v)
   - Measures γ on perturbed data
   - Records γ_perturbed
3. Analyzes distribution of γ values
4. Tests stability: σ(γ_perturbed) vs σ(γ_original)

**Output:**
- Original: γ = 1.866 ± 0.012
- Perturbed mean: γ = 1.865 ± 0.013
- Additional scatter: 0.001 (negligible)
- Measurement stable to 5% perturbations

**Runtime:** ~2 hours (1000 iterations)

## FACTS vs CLAIMS

### FACTS:
✓ 1000 Monte Carlo perturbations
✓ Mean γ shifts by 0.001 (0.05%)
✓ RMS scatter increases 0.001 (8% increase)
✓ All realizations give 1.84 < γ < 1.89

### CLAIMS:
→ CLAIM: "Measurement robust to data noise"
   EVIDENCE: ±5% noise → <0.1% change in γ
   CAVEAT: Gaussian noise may not match real systematics
