# EFT.py (Effective Field Theory)

## WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES (Plain English)

This connects γ = 1.878 to modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations using effective field theory. It's exploring: "What if dark matter halos obey polytropic equation of state with index related to γ?"

**WARNING:** HIGHLY SPECULATIVE. Option B material only.

## WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES (Scientific Detail)

**Process:**
1. Assumes polytropic EOS: P = K ρ^Γ where Γ = 1 + 1/n
2. Relates polytropic index to power-law exponent: n ≈ 1/(γ-1)
3. For γ = 1.878: n ≈ 1.14
4. Solves modified TOV equations with this index
5. Predicts density profile

**Output:**
- Modified TOV solution
- Density profile ρ(r)
- Comparison with NFW

**Runtime:** ~30 minutes

## FACTS vs CLAIMS

### FACTS:
✓ TOV equations are well-established
✓ Polytropic EOS is standard form
✓ Γ = 1.878 gives specific solution
✓ Code correctly solves TOV

### CLAIMS (ALL SPECULATIVE):
→ CLAIM: "Dark matter halos obey polytropic EOS"
   EVIDENCE: None (speculative assumption)

→ CLAIM: "Polytropic index related to γ"
   EVIDENCE: Dimensional analysis only (not derived)

→ CLAIM: "This predicts halo structure"
   EVIDENCE: Equations give profile (but assumption unjustified)

**CLASSIFICATION:** Speculative Theory (Option B Only)
