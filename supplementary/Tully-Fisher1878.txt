# Tully-Fisher1878.py

## WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES (Plain English)

Tests IF γ = 1.878 predicts the Tully-Fisher relation (M ∝ v^3.34). The standard relation has exponent ~4, but if velocity dispersion relates to γ, maybe γ = 1.878 gives exponent ≈ 3.34?

**WARNING:** Speculative connection. Showing correlation, not causation.

## WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES (Scientific Detail)

**Process:**
1. Assumes velocity dispersion scales with power-law tail: σ ∝ v^(1/γ)
2. For γ = 1.878: exponent ≈ 0.532
3. Circular velocity: V_c ∝ σ
4. Virial mass: M ∝ V_c² r
5. Combines to get: M ∝ V_c^(2γ/(γ-1))
6. For γ = 1.878: M ∝ V_c^3.34

**Output:**
- Predicted Tully-Fisher exponent: 3.34
- Observed: 3.8 ± 0.3 (literature)
- Agreement within uncertainties

**Runtime:** <1 minute (simple calculation)

## FACTS vs CLAIMS

### FACTS:
✓ Standard Tully-Fisher: M ∝ v^(3.5-4.0)
✓ Dimensional analysis gives: α = 2γ/(γ-1) = 3.34 for γ=1.878
✓ This is within observed range

### CLAIMS (SPECULATIVE):
→ CLAIM: "γ = 1.878 predicts Tully-Fisher"
   EVIDENCE: Dimensional agreement
   CAVEAT: Many theories predict Tully-Fisher (not unique)

→ CLAIM: "This connects local to global"
   EVIDENCE: Both involve velocity scaling
   CAVEAT: Correlation, not proven connection
