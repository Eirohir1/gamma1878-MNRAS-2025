## WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES (Plain English)

This explores connection between γ = 1.878 and modified general relativity through polytropic equation of state in TOV equations.

**WARNING:** Most speculative of all scripts. Modified GR requires extraordinary evidence.

## WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES (Scientific Detail)

**Process:**
1. Modifies TOV equations with polytropic EOS
2. Relates polytrope to γ via Γ = γ/(γ-1)
3. Solves for metric modifications
4. Tests if this reproduces observations

**Output:**
- Modified metric
- Predictions for lensing, rotation curves
- Comparison with standard GR + DM

**Runtime:** ~1 hour

## FACTS vs CLAIMS

### FACTS:
✓ Mathematics is formally correct
✓ Modified TOV equations solvable

### CLAIMS (EXTREMELY SPECULATIVE):
→ CLAIM: "Need modified gravity"
   EVIDENCE: None (standard GR + DM works fine)

→ CLAIM: "γ = 1.878 indicates GR breakdown"
   EVIDENCE: None (measured in simulation using standard physics!)

**CLASSIFICATION:** Highly Speculative (Option B, with extreme caution)
**JUSTIFICATION:** Exploratory only, no physical basis
**STATUS:** Preliminary mathematical exercise
**PUBLICATION:** ✗ DEFINITELY NOT for Option A
**WARNING:** Could damage credibility if presented without strong caveats
